# galactic-unicorn

Experiments with the pre-production galactic unicorn.

I've written a basic [cheerlights](https://cheerlights.com/) client. The first version just shows a solid single-colour display across the
whole of the Galactic Unicorn.

I'm changing the code to use Pimoroni's networking library. Once that's done you'll be able to run the client by copying
`cheerlights.py` to your Unicorn and running it using Thonny.
