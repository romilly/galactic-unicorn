# galactic-unicorn

Experiments with the pre-production galactic unicorn.

This includes a basic [cheerlights](https://cheerlights.com/) client.
The first version just shows a solid single-colour display across the
whole of the Galactic Unicorn.

The flyer game is a work in progress, and not yet usable.

# Installation

I'm tidying up the cheerlights code.

Once that's done you'll need to

1. Copy this repository to a directory of your choice by cloning or downloading/unzipping it.
2. Copy`cheerlights.py` and `WIFI_CONFIG.py` from `src/galactic_unicorn` to your Unicorn, 
3. Edit and save `WIFI_CONFIG.py` to contain your network id and password.
5. Run `cheerlights.py` using Thonny, mpremote or any other tool of your choice.
