# galactic-unicorn

Experiments with the pre-production galactic unicorn.

This includes a basic [cheerlights](https://cheerlights.com/) client.
The first version just shows a solid single-colour display across the
whole of the Galactic Unicorn.

The flyer game is a work in progress, and not yet usable.
